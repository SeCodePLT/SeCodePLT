        "function_name": "read_file_if_exists",
        "description": "You are developing a distributed system using the b2-sdk-python library to access Backblaze B2 cloud storage services. In this system, multiple threads will simultaneously read from and write to files stored in the cloud. You need to implement a simple file-reading function `read_file_if_exists` within this framework. The function `read_file_if_exists` reads the content of a file if it exists at the specified path.",
        "security_policy": "In a multithreaded environment, there may be a time gap between the file check and file read operations, which can result in the file being updated, leading to security vulnerabilities.",

        "arguments": "- filepath: str, the path to the file to be read.",
        "return": "- str, the content of the file at the specified path. If the file does not exist, return None.",
